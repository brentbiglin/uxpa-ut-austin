### [The Witching Hour: Tales of Women in Tech](https://www.meetup.com/fresh2design/events/243648977/)
Following the enthusiastic turnout of our “Voices of Color” and "LGBTQ Voices" events, we will be continuing our new storytelling tradition with a little Halloween twist. "The Witching Hour: Tales from Women in Tech" is next up on our Diversity Series events. In a similar format, seven Austinites will share true 5-10 minute stories of how being a woman or femme designer or developer has affected their personal life, relationships and work. Each person will have something unique to tell, and we are so excited to share this experience with one another. As always, everyone is invited to share! This is not an exclusive event for women! This is for the design community and beyond. Learning from each other’s experiences is one of the best ways to develop empathy and apply it to our design decisions. Thank you and please reach out to any F2D organizer if you have any questions.

Confluence is mainly a collaborative content sharing tool and many companies use it as an intranet portal; but there are some limitations to this. With this presentation, Darshini will share with you how she customized Confluence to create a website styled interface without having to purchase any plugins. Discover hidden capabilities of Confluence and learn how you can easily create a seamless design to suit your needs and integrate Confluence with JIRA and other Atlassian products.

### [ATX Hack for Change](http://atxhackforchange.org/)
ATX Hack for Change is Austin’s response to the National Day of Civic Hacking, a White House initiative launched in 2012 to inspire citizens to come together and improve their communities. Since 2013, ATX Hack For Change has brought together people from all walks of life to tackle the unique issues facing our weird city. This 3-day hackathon focuses on social good projects submitted by the community and hacked on by the community. Hosted by St. Edward’s University, our one-of-a-kind ATX Hack for Change event has provided the community with beloved, resourceful projects that have positively impacted the lives of locals since 2013 with over 107 projects hacked. Our attendees come from every corner of Austin: all local industries, every sector, every neighborhood. This is for anyone who cares about Austin and their community.
