### [ATX Hack for Change](http://atxhackforchange.org/)
ATX Hack for Change is Austin’s response to the National Day of Civic Hacking, a White House initiative launched in 2012 to inspire citizens to come together and improve their communities. Since 2013, ATX Hack For Change has brought together people from all walks of life to tackle the unique issues facing our weird city. This 3-day hackathon focuses on social good projects submitted by the community and hacked on by the community. Hosted by St. Edward’s University, our one-of-a-kind ATX Hack for Change event has provided the community with beloved, resourceful projects that have positively impacted the lives of locals since 2013 with over 107 projects hacked. Our attendees come from every corner of Austin: all local industries, every sector, every neighborhood. This is for anyone who cares about Austin and their community.
